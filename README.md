Current Progress
Suction Assembly

The suction mechanism has been successfully designed and tested.
The vacuum gripper effectively picks up paper petals, and the corresponding code is available in the repository.
The suction functionality has been integrated and tested thoroughly, ensuring reliable petal pickup.
Inverse Kinematics

A custom inverse kinematics solution has been developed.
Currently, the inverse kinematics code is under refinement to achieve higher accuracy and smooth motion.
The robot can move petals from the pickup area to the gluing area and then return to the home position, though work is ongoing to improve precision.
Merged Arduino Code

The Arduino code has been prepared and merged, combining both suction and inverse kinematics functionalities.
The merged code enables coordinated actions: picking up petals, applying glue, and assembling the flower efficiently.

suction and inverse kinematics's videoa are attached along with their arduino  code
Also, the combined suction and inverse kinmeatics code is attached. However, we are right now working on the inverse kinematics section more.
